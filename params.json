  "body": "# Application Insights for Semantic Logging.\r\n\r\nSend data from [Semantic Logging](https://github.com/mspnp/semantic-logging) to [Application Insights](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/application-insights/) for display, analysis and diagnostics.\r\n\r\nWith [semantic logging](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn440729.aspx), you call trace methods named for the event - for example, `log.GameWon(score)` instead of `log.InfoFormat(\"won a game, score {0}\", score)`.  The [Semantic Logging Application Block](https://github.com/mspnp/semantic-logging) (SLAB) provides a useful framework on which you can create custom log methods and couple them to one or more sinks.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this project is to integrate Semantic Logging with Application Insights. Log messages are sent to the Application Insights portal. Application Insights provides a powerful diagnostic search tool, which allows you to search and correlate associated events, including data from client, server and other components of your application. It also shows you charts of trends in performance and usage over time. By using SLAB to send the logs, you introduce an additional level of clarity to your trace code.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributors ##\r\n  - <a href='https://github.com/fidmor89'>Fidel Esteban Morales Cifuentes</a>.\r\n  - <a href='https://github.com/chirislash'>Luis Roberto Rosales Enriquez</a>.\r\n  - <a href='https://github.com/chepix10'>Jose Luis Morales Ruiz</a>.\r\n  - <a href='https://github.com/josemen'>Jose Carlos Mendez</a>.\r\n  - <a href='https://github.com/jarodriguez08'>Jorge Andres Rodriguez Cuevas</a>.\r\n  - <a href='https://github.com/herbertharriola'>Herberth Francisco Arriola</a>.\r\n  - <a href='https://github.com/oscargarciacolon'>Oscar Garcia Colon - Teacher and Facilitator</a>.\r\n  \r\n\r\nSpecial Thanks to \r\nAndrew Oakley for all his help with this project.\r\n\r\n\r\nTags: Application Insights Semantic Logging Nuget\r\n\r\nRequires: \r\n- Newtonsoft.Json\r\n- EnterpriseLibrary.SemanticLogging\r\n- Microsoft.ApplicationInsights\r\n\r\nTested on:\r\n- Newtonsoft.Json (≥ 7.0.1)\r\n- EnterpriseLibrary.SemanticLogging (≥ 2.0.1406.1)\r\n- Microsoft.ApplicationInsights (≥ 0.17.1-beta)\r\n\r\nLicense: GNU GPL 3.0\r\n\r\nLicense URI: http://opensource.org/licenses/GPL-3.0\r\n\r\nCopyright 2015 The SL Integration with Application Insights Project Developers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Description ##\r\n\r\nThis packages is intended for users of Semantic Logging that want to seamlessly convert logs captured by SL and send them to Application Insights service on Azure.
